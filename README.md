# Catalan Numbers Formalization Project (team e)

We have solved all the small tasks

1. Formalize the catalan numbers using their recursive definition. [(solution)](Catalan/Catalan.lean)
2. Formalize the concept of plane trees. [(solution)](Catalan/PlaneTrees.lean)
3. Formalize the concept of full binary trees. [(solution)](Catalan/BinaryTrees.lean)
4. Construct the type of full binary trees with n nodes, not counting the
leaves. [(solution)](Catalan/BinaryTrees.lean)
5. Define the type of ballot sequences of length n. [(solution)](Catalan/Ballots.lean)

and three large tasks

4. Construct a bijection between lists of plane trees and plane trees. [(solution)](Catalan/PlaneTrees.lean)

5. Construct the rotating isomorphism, which is the isomorphism between plane trees and full binary trees. [(solution)](Catalan/RotatingIsomorphism.lean)
